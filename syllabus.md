## Course Syllabus
### Learning Objectives

This class aims to teach students how to design and build robotic systems from a creative perspective. While you will enhance your making skills through specific technical training,  this class focuses on employing artistic tools to tackle creation. To do so, we will examine how robotic systems are employed by artists, designers, and the entertainment industry to create engaging experiences. 

Upon completing this course, you will be able to:
- Develop custom mechanisms using digital and analog fabrication techniques
- Develop custom embedded electronic circuits
- Program responsive and interactive behaviors for embedded systems
- Develop aesthetic sensibilities for robotic systems
- Learn about the history of new media art with a focus on kinetic and robotic systems
- Gain an understanding of robotic applications in the entertainment industry
 


### Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites for the course. You will be required to complete the [Wilson Center  Basic Workshop Safety Training I and the Robotics Basic Workshop Safety Training II](https://teamprojects.engin.umich.edu/home/training/)



### Required Materials

There are no required text books for this course. Any reading materials, images, and videos pertaining to covered topics will be provided by the instructors.  

### Course Structure

This course is broadly divided into 3 modules, that allows you to explore a technical topic along with a  specific aesthetic theme. Each module will have various readings, artists/art viewings, technical instruction, time for hands-on experimentation, and a project. The modules for this semester are as follows:

- Project 1 -  Digital Surrealist Object:  Augmenting a found object using CAD and digital fabrication techniques

- Project 2 - Motorized Automata: Creating a handmade automata with a motor and supporting circuitry

- Project 3 - Emotive Object: Developing an object that responds to external stimuli through sensors

- Final - Group Project



### Course Grading
- Projects (X 3) : 55%
- Final Project : 25%
- Creative Process Journal (Blog) :  10%
- Attendance Class Participation + Critique : 10%
- **Total: 100%**  

#### Final Grade

| > 93| A |
| 88 - 93| A-  |
| 83 - 87| B+ |
| 78 - 82| B- |
| 73 - 77| C+ |
| 68 - 73| C- |
| 63 - 67| D+ |
| < 63 | F |

### Grading Policies

All projects are graded using the following rubic: 

|100%|  Project displays exceptional craftsmanship or clear effort into going above (extra motions, extra motors etc etc)|
|90%|  Project functions and has met all the requirements |
|80%| Project is complete but does not meet all the requirements |
|70%| Project is incomplete and does not function |
|60%| Project was not presented for critique but documentation of process |
|0%| Project was not turned in on time |

10% will be deducted for each day your project is late beyond the due date



### Student Blogs

Documentation is an essential component of any creative practice. You must appropriately document all the assignments, thought processes, sketches, prototypes, making processes, and final work completed in this course. This will be done on your blog. You are free to use any platform as long as it is viewable by everyone in the course. Each project will require you to create a minimum of 5 posts, i.e., 1-2 initial idea sketches, 2-3 photos of "in-progress" work, 1-2 photos/text of inspiration sources, and 1-2 images/videos of the completed work. Additionally, you must write a (250 word min) **project statement** with each project. In this statement you should explain your thought process, reasoning of the decisions you made, your objectives etc. Here is a good reference: https://photoplacegallery.com/blog/artist-and-project-statements/ 

Without these blog posts, your project sumbission will be considered incomplete. 

### Attendance & Project Critiques

Regular attendance and relevant participation in-class activities are required. Anyone arriving after 10:55 AM will be marked late. Being late for class 3 times counts as an unexcused absence. 2 unexcused absences equal a reduction of one whole grade point. Missing class OR an early departure, without permission, from class also constitutes an absence. A total of 3 unexcused absences will result in failing the class. If you must miss a class, it is your responsibility to get notes and assignments from a classmate. 

A critique is a critical analysis of the work that you have developed and is an important part of any creative practice. Critique discussions will include constructive comments on the relationships between ideas and intentions, historical and contemporary references, as well as the choice of technical concepts and processes. You are expected to objectively articulate and discuss your work as well as the work of others. Participation in class discussions and critiques is essential!

All projects will be presented to instructors and fellow classmates, in this time students should be able to answer the following questions,
- What inspired you to choose this subject matter? 
- Is there a story behind it?
- What were your roses, buds and thorns? (i.e what went well, what went ok and what did you struggle with)
- What element was made by hand? How did you do it?
- If given the chance to revisit this piece, what would you do differently?


### Student Wellbeing & Equal Opportunity

#### Commitment to equal opportunity
We ask that all students to treat each other with respect. As indicated in the [General Standards of Conduct for Engineering Students](https://bulletin.engin.umich.edu/rules/), this course is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all persons and does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, marital status, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, disability, religion, height, weight, or veteran status. Please feel free to contact the course staff with any problem, concern, or suggestion. The University of Michigan [Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities](https://oscr.umich.edu/statement) provides greater detail about expected behavior and conflict resolution in our community of scholarship.

#### Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
If you believe an accommodation is needed for a disability, please let the course instructor know at your earliest convenience. Some aspects of this course, including the assignments, the in-class activities, and the way the course is usually taught, may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the [Services for Students with Disabilities](http://ssd.umich.edu/) (SSD, 734-763-3000) office to help us determine appropriate academic accommodations. SSD typically recommends accommodations through a Verified Individualized Services and Accommodations (VISA) form.
