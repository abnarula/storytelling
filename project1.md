**Learning Outcomes:** By completing this project, you will be able to:
- Create 3D models in CAD  
- Create physical objects using digital fabrication tools & techniques
- Learn how to augment 
- Critcally engage with artistic concepts of Surrealism/Dadism 

**Project Requirements:** At a minimum, your project must have the following components to count towards a complete submission: 
- You must use a found object. This is an object you have not made.
