### Class Description

In this hands-on studio style course, you will learn how to create basic electronic circuits, fabricate custom mechanisms and program interactive behaviors to create kinetic and robotic art works. Using personal, cultural and political narratives, you will create poetic, engaging and thought-provoking pieces at the intersection of technology, art and design. The class will culminate in an exhibition to showcase final projects.  

This course emphasizes hands-on experimentation and exploration. The course is specifically structured so that you ‘learn by doing’. This process will not only strengthen your technical foundation but will also help you to explore the aesthetics possibilities of robotic mechanisms.

In addition to technical understanding, you will also explore the history of artistic practices and the various themes that have emerged with the use of electronics and other computational media in art and design. Broadly categorized under the term New Media Art, we will explore
how other artists strive to create new forms and aesthetic experiences. In this course, we will aim to learn this language to develop, explore and expand our own aesthetics.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
